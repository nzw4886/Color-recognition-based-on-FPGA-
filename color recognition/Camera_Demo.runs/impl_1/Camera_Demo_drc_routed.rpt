BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF/IBUF (in Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining

Net MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/set_y_o_reg[5]_47[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/temp_rgb_data_reg[1][23]_i_1/O, cell MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/temp_rgb_data_reg[1][23]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
